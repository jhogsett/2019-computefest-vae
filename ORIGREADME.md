## Preparing for the workshop
Thanks for your interest in our workshop! We will try to provide each attendee with a cloud-based GPU instance. However, technical difficulties may occur, and we want to make sure that in this event you still have the chance to follow by running code locally on your laptop.

Please prepare by setting up an environment as follows:

1) Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2019-computefest.git`
2) Navigate to this folder `cd 2019-computefest/Wednesday/auto_encoder`
3) Install virtualenv, if not installed right now: `pip install virtualenv`
4) Create a new environment: `virtualenv workshop`
5) Activate the new environment: Mac/Unix: `source workshop/bin/activate` // Windows: `.\workshop\Scripts\activate`
6) Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Depending on your operating system, some of the steps might deviate slightly. If you have problems, please refer to official documentation such as https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/ for troubleshooting.

#### More material will be posted after the workshop. Thank you!
